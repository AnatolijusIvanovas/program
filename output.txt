To be, or not to be, that is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And by opposing end them. To die—to sleep,
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
That flesh is heir to: 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub:
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
Than fly to others that we know not of?
